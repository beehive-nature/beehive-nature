//! `identity.root` + the Capability primitive (Phase 2 scaffold) — the
//! authorization core behind the console's multi-domain, one-DID access model
//! (design brief §2.5).
//!
//! The model, stated plainly:
//! - A [`Did`] is a principal (`did:autonomi:…` root, `did:plc:…` persona).
//!   Events and authorization key off DIDs, never raw public keys, so key
//!   rotation never orphans access (the constitution's identity rule).
//! - A [`Capability`] is a UCAN-shaped `(with, can)` pair: *which resource* and
//!   *which ability*. "Give the design seat read on the farm panel" is a
//!   capability; "the wallet may spend" is another.
//! - A [`Delegation`] is a signed, delegable, revocable grant from an issuer
//!   DID to an audience DID, optionally time-bound. This is the UCAN token; it
//!   is what lets one self-authenticated DID walk into any BNRi domain and get
//!   exactly the layers/features/assets its attestation permits.
//!
//! **What v1 delivers now (compile-safe, fully tested):** the *authorization
//! core* — capability matching (ability hierarchy with `*` wildcards) and
//! time-bound validity. This is the logic every panel gates on, and it needs no
//! crypto to be correct.
//!
//! **What gates behind the [`Verifier`] trait (the pending crypto step):**
//! signature issuance and verification (Ed25519 over the delegation's canonical
//! form) and the delegation-chain proof. Kept behind a trait — not a `todo!()`
//! — so the unbuilt crypto never sits in a shipped path, matching the adapter
//! discipline. A real verifier lands once its curve API is compile-verified.
